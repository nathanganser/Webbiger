Paid crypto community

 ## Purpose
 I've been following [Aragon](https://aragon.org)'s journey for a while now and have always been excited by the idea of a decentralized organization. Thanks to crypto, this can become a reality. 

Governance is the second topic I'm really excited about. The ability to rethink the way organizations could work in the future really motivates me. 

It's for this purpose that I started to build a community a few years back, mostly in french. This is my attempt at creating a self-functioning, financially viable, decentralized organization.
